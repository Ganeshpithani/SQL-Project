# 📊 SQL Student Learning Project

## 👨‍🎓 Introduction

This repository contains my SQL practice work created while learning database concepts from the basics.
The project is designed to understand how data is stored, connected, and queried using SQL in a simple and practical way.

I used small real-life examples like school and student data to clearly understand each SQL concept.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project I learned:

* What is a Database
* What is a Table, Row, Column
* Difference between SQL command types (DDL, DML, DQL)
* How to create and manage tables
* How to insert, update and delete records
* How to retrieve filtered data
* How to group and summarize data
* How to connect multiple tables using keys

## 🏗 Database Design Used

### 1. Students Table

Stores student basic details like:

* ID
* Name
* Age
* Class

### 2. Subjects Table

Stores subject names:

* Subject ID
* Subject Name

### 3. Marks Table

Stores marks of students in subjects:

* Student ID
* Subject ID
* Marks

This structure helped me understand relationships between tables.

## 🔑 Keys Used

* **Primary Key** → Used to uniquely identify each student and subject
* **Foreign Key** → Used to connect Marks table with Students and Subjects

This is similar to using Roll Number to connect multiple registers.
